# Seekers Login

In this project I demonstrate a login system (based on google/fb) that upon login provide
the user with recent data about a stock (taken from yahoo).

This project was written for the purpose of demonstrating some of my web development
capabilities.

Client is built with React + Redux,

Server side is with Meteor - taking into account security, sending data only to logged in users.
